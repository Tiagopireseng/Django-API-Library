# Django and React Dockerized App with PostgreSQL

Note that this project does not use Nginx and Gunicorn so is not ready for production and the psycop2g used is only the binary version which should be updated when moving to production


#Initiate application

If you have docker installed simply hit docker-compose build and then docker-compose up on your terminal, this should start the application.

In the actual stage it should only be possible to make CRUD operations after composing the containers.
